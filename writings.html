            Unfurling the haphazardly tied threads of emotions seemed complicated to accomplish. A myriad of internal and external factors most probably have cast their evil spells on it. The repercussions thus followed, were insurmountable. 
            <br><br>
            When a situation puts on an ugly face, emotions tend to take an excruciating diabolic form. They hate to disguise themselves from then on, and blatantly put forth the melancholia. None adore it; nevertheless, it’s inevitable. Everything slips away from the impenetrable obstacles, despite that, the heaviness of the inexplicable weight of emotions surges. The motionless body walks and runs. The hunger pangs pester, but that’s extraneous. Each passing day counts as worthless. There’s nothing more to do. Everything’s done and dusted. Period.
            <br><br>
            As days pass by, emotions quarrel among themselves. Hormonal imbalance dominates neurological functioning. The quest for stability takes its form. Brooding turns to brainstorming, and reality starts sinking in. Criticism and dominance aren’t part of the play anymore. It’s just you all the way! You matter the most to yourself. Anything you do, the rationale matters to only ‘you’. You hunt for the hidden soul to define yourself blazingly quick. You crave to prove your words and actions. The morals and principles you follow, stand by you all along. Taking the flak is of no concern, and you constantly endeavor to do what you love!
            <br>
            Thus, the threads have been unfurled.

            Everything seems blissful on the flat surface we’re standing upon. We laugh with no regrets holding us back, we babble about an endless number of things, and we work to make the world a better place. The road we’re traveling upon is smooth. 
            <br><br>
            Out of the blue, a terrible storm comes out of nowhere, and transports us, rather formally, into an abyss. The unbeknownst agony finds its way out through a labyrinth of heart rhythms. The wound is unhealable. Isolation is what we go after. Everyone keeps us far away from the souls we’re emotionally stuck to, but none pushes the two sides closer.
            <br>
            Nonetheless, we seek to travel alone. The spirit dampeners shower all along the line, we lick the sweet-and-sour sauce and pursue our goals. The distance, however, doesn’t relinquish and continually takes on the winning side. This further crumples the few remaining lively chunks of soul and thrusts us deeper into the dark abyss.
